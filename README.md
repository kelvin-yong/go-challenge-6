### Maze Generator

Two types of maze are generated. Both are [perfect](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm) mazes, meaning there are no loops.

Non-perfect mazes requires a more intelligent maze solver to solve but in general, given the same maze dimension (15 x 10), a perfect maze takes more steps to solve.

#### Kruskal
This maze is generated by [Kruskal's algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/3/maze-generation-kruskal-s-algorithm).

Given that the start and end points are randomly placed, the average number of steps taken to solve the maze (via Tremaux algorithm) is **133**.

#### Pocket
I call it pocket maze because it has deep vertical pockets. Pockets may face up or down. Average steps is **136**.

#### Other Mazes (considered but not used)
Empty Maze - this map with most loops and multiple solutions. But average steps is low. Only **95**.

Linear Maze - this map has only one single path. Not surprising, the average steps is **100**.

Recursive Backtracking - this [generated map](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking) is a perfect maze, but the average steps **116** pales in comparison to Kruskal and Pocket.

#### Maze Solver

The defacto algorithm for the person-focused maze solver (i.e. the person in the maze knows nothing about the maze, has no aerial view) is Trémaux's Algorithm.

Trémaux asks that you backtrack when you have reached a deadend (or a junction that has no new paths). While backtracking, you will explore the first junction you come to that that has unvisited paths. Very similar to recursive backtracking.

Say I started at `A` and decided to move west, and eventually ended up at `B`, which is considered a deadend. According to Trémaux, you will attempt to backtrack to `A`. However along the way, you encounter a junction with unvisted path (leading to `C`), so stop at explore that junction.

That junction is 3 steps away from `B`

	___ C_______
	|  ______ B|
	|________ A|


I have used an enhanced version that instead of backtracking blindly, will see choose the next junction to go to based on steps required. In this case when it is at `B`, it will take 1 step south to `A` and continue exploration.

We don't know if the treasure/destination is at `C` or at south of `A`, but we will attempt to move to the nearest unexplored junction.

Using the empty maze as a reference, the average steps are as follows:

* Trémaux's: 95
* Enhanced: 83
* Enhanced, with path prioritisation: 77

There is no performance gain if the maze is a perfect maze.
